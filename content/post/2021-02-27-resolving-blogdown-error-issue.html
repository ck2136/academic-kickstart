<h1>Problem: Error when compiling Hugo using ‘Academic’ template</h1>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve updated my website and I sorta expected that there would be errors that would pop up while I post new R code. BUT… there was essentially an issue in the hugo compilation step. Specifically in the <code>Academic</code> template. This will be a really short post to help people that may have similar issues.</p>

<h1>Solution: Change a few lines of code.</h1>
<p>Specifically, line 14 of the <code>theme/academic/layouts/publication/single.html</code> contains the below code:</p>
<p><code>{{ if (.Params.publication_types) and (ne (index .Params.publication_types 0) &quot;0&quot;) }}</code></p>
<p>Essentially the code should be updated to the below code:</p>
<p><code>{{ if (and (.Params.publication_types) (ne (index .Params.publication_types 0) &quot;0&quot;)) }}</code></p>
<p>This is due to a code update that occured (somewhere in version 0.7 to 0.8) where the top code leads to a logical error thereby leading to compilation error.</p>
<p>Well… That’s about it! I hope this will be helpful for people that made Hugo sites before version 0.8. Happy coding!</p>
